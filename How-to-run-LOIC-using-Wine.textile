*Assuming you have Ubuntu/Debian:*

# Download latest LOIC and extract.
# Open a terminal and type (without the parenthesis) "sudo apt-get install wine" and wait for it to finish.
# Type "wget [[http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks]]".
# Type "sh winetricks" and from the GUI select dotnet20, and install it.
# Go to applications on your drop down and under Wine click on "Browse C: drive" then move the extracted LOIC to c:
# Now, go to the extracted file and right-click LOIC.exe and click properties.
# Go to permissions tab and check the box "Allow executing this file as program".
# Right click file again and under open application, select wine.

*Addendum:* Please refer to this issue for more recent instructions on getting wine installed on our system: "LOIC#83":https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/issues/83

bq.. Wine instructions doesnt work directly as it mentioned here it needs some improvements:

There is Wine64 and Wine32 , @apt install wine@ it will install wine64 because Debian and most distros deprecating/not using by default i386 architecture, so user need to specify the wine version.

Better refer the user to install wine on debian from the official website of winehq:

[[https://wiki.winehq.org/Debian]]

(why do we need 32bit? because loic architecture is 32bit)

p. Enjoy ;)
